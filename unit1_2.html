        <h2>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h2>
        
        <p>    
            In this section, I’ll say briefly which tools I used, and then describe their appropriateness in the section immediately following this. I coded mostly in VS Code, occasionally opening Sublime Text, pretty much only for the purpose of being able to switch easily between windows with the two different application icons in my launchpad when I had far too many files open - e.g. all the website pages, and all my code snippet notes from earlier learning/trying out. I’ve used Trello as the project management tool for this site.

        <h2>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h2>
        
        <p>    
            I talk a bit about what I like about VS Code vs other IDEs in 1.1.5: namely, it’s eagerness to close tags and brackets, that it highlights when I’ve done some silly syntax, and that it clearly has a whole range of features. It’s obviously far preferable, particularly for a beginner who appreciates syntax reminders, to code in an IDE as opposed to something like a word processor. Obviously the ultimate aim is to be able to code like in the films, line by line with absolutely perfect syntax straight off the bat... I'll stick with the friendly  IDE pointers!
        </p>
        <p>     
            Let's talk Trello for project management. Previously, I managed work projects in an Excel spreadsheet, where I preferred to group tasks first and foremost according to the sort of task they were (so I had headings for e.g. research tasks, journal review and editing tasks, event organisation, admin, etc. and nested subsections listing individual tasks within each of these, along with their deadlines. I implemented Kanban principles over the top of this structure via colour coding (none for to do, yellow for doing, pale green for review, dark green for done, etc.). I found that when you have several disparate tasks, each with a number of nested subtasks, which need completing in parallel, I prefer to see these tasks grouped according to what sort of task they are first and foremost, and then grouped according to Kanban as a secondary classification (in this case, colour coded). So far, I haven’t found a way to display subtasks nested within parent headings (with all items visible from the home view), as well as implementing Kanban principles on Trello. Perhaps this functionality exists, I just haven’t found it as easily as I found out how to colour code cells in Excel! I’m used to my old ways, so I expect I have a bit of somewhat irrational brand loyalty to the Sophie System that I need to shake off. 
        </p>
        <p>     
            I have enjoyed using the checklist feature – that helped me organise more complex tasks I needed to complete, such as getting the design into CSS. No doubt Trello boards look much tidier than Excel, too. And one can add notes to tasks more neatly, this is surely motivational – a tidy Trello, a tidy mind, isn’t that the phrase?   
        </p> 
        <p>
            Since Trello is web based, it does make it easy for multiple people to be able to access and update a board simultaneously, perhaps more so than setting up shared documents with e.g. OneDrive, so that would have helped if this was a team project.
        </p>    
        <p>
            There are some aspects I dislike about Trello. Deleting cards that I realise I don’t need is a faff – you have to go via the archive which is several clicks away, archive the card, and then delete it (after confirming several times that this is in fact what you want to do.)  
        </p>

            We’ve used Slack for communicating, the dissemination of materials, and staying in touch about the project. Generally, I like Slack, but here’s one thing that’s a pain: finding content on a busy Slack message board that is even a few days old can be a bit difficult. For instance, in 1.1, I list the names, job roles, and companies of the lightning talk speakers, and I went to Slack (where they had been posted each day) to double check I had recorded the right information. Unless you know a key word that was definitely used in some content (and not used that much in other content!), you do end up having to scroll manually to find what you need. But let’s face it, Slack is just infinitely preferable to having all of that content in an inbox. Imagine getting <em>emailed</em> GIFs the rate at which you get sent them on Slack! Phew!

        <h2>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</h2>
        
        <p>    
            I’m basically happy with this as a first go. It’s been a good learning experience. 
        </p>
        <p>     
            There are some design aspects that annoy me, which I haven’t been able to fix: I’d like the text in the “nav bar” to be centred vertically, but couldn’t find a simple way to do this. I’d also like the link in the nav bar to be clickable from the whole image, rather than just the text, so it feels more like a button. I saw a way to do this in CSS but it looked complex, and the sort of thing people actually tend to do in Javascript. I’d also like to have removed the default formatting of applying an underline to link text, and have instead a different colour to signal there’s a link. I'd also have like to have added the key-hover feature to links. I found ways to do these things right at the end of the project, and became too scared to make any changes that close to the deadline to try them out! With more time, I’ll be a more gutsy CSS experimenter, I promise!

        <h2>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h2>
        
        <p>    
            I’d certainly be looking to get some Javascript on here, for reasons described above. 
        </p>
        <p>     
            Furthermore, the site only really works on desktop, not small tablets or phones. There's some weird behaviour of things which should be centred (but aren't) when I opened it on my phone. So further improvements would be to get a version working for those devices too!  
        </p>
        <p>     
            I’m not totally convinced I’ve got as little CSS as possible for the visual effects achieved here - e.g. I sniff some bloated code in the background. For instance, I had to add the different background images to each page separately, but they all have the same behaviour, which I’ve copied and pasted over and over and over. I expect there’s a way to define a class of backgrounds to save some code, and then specify different pictures for different pages within that. If I wasn’t scared of breaking everything close to the deadline, I’d have sorted that out!   
        </p>
        <p>
            It would be great if the nav bar was pinned to the top of the screen even as you scroll down. I know that functionality exists in CSS and I just didn't have time to implement it.

        <h2>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h2>
        
        <p>    
            My site meets the minimum requirements set in the assignment. I’ve got my html skeleton, some CSS styling over the top, use of images, and use of Google Fonts. It’s responsive to window resizing thanks to relatively sized divs (e.g. using %) and a flexbox nav bar and homepage sitemap. I’ve tried to add a few extras into the design that we didn’t go over in class, e.g. rounded edges, different opacities, and filters to tone down the colours and draw things together a bit. 
        </p>
        <p>     
            I’ve tested tested tested throughout, and I’m happy things look and work as they should (notwithstanding things flagged in 2.3 and 2.4 above). Ideally I’d get someone else to test for user experience and readability and that sort of thing, but this is a solo assignment, so I’ve refrained from that.  
        </p>
        <p>     
            Finally, I’ve thought carefully about the questions set, done considerable research and tried to immerse myself in the dev mindset in order to provide what I hope are thoughtful answers to these set questions. With more time I’d like to have been able to do more research, and tidy things up a bit. Oh well, a lifetime ahead for that!
