        <h2>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business </h2>
        <p>
            <blockquote>“All companies are technology companies now.”</blockquote> 
        </p>
        <p>    
            Thus speaks Patrick Fisher, Global Business Director, Technology Practice Group[1]. No doubt he’s neither the first nor the last to have expressed this sentiment. 
        </p>
        <p>     
            Let’s take a quick look around to see what he means. Innovation in the automotive industry is increasingly focused on tech for autonomous applications and user interactivity[2], whilst for any firms whose business is selling <em>things</em>, inventory management is streamlined, scalable and flexible thanks to a variety of technologies[3]. Then look at the banks - there’s a reason the financial centre of the UK is co-located with the country’s main internet hub (in the Docklands of East London)[4].  
        </p>
        <p>     
            What about SMEs, public sector, and not-for-profits? They too benefit from improved data management and customer/user relationship management and that comes with embedding day to day processes within tech solutions. When the University of Birmingham (a previous employer of mine) switched all systems onto a new centralised administrative core, it saved staff a lot of paperwork, and gave us the ability to complete many of our administrative tasks from any location with an internet connection. Organisations who’ve already done this are showing themselves to be more adaptable and accommodating in the face of the global pandemic, and will likely also find themselves more resilient to future crises.  
        </p> 
        <p>
            As well as simply replicating processes once completed on paper digitally, we’re also seeing the development of entirely new business models because of advances in machine learning and data science.[5] Even as I type this, I’m listening to my “Discover Weekly” playlist on Spotify, favouriting songs here and there, gently but surely feeding its algorithms to give me a little bit less 2-chord landfill indie and a little bit more experimental banjo folktronica. Really. This is a world where almost anything is possible. 
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="content">
        <h2>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills? </h2>
        <p>
            Perhaps a good starting point for successful project work is to equip yourself with knowledge and skills in the languages relevant to the aspect of development in which you want to specialise. On the job boards it looks as if Python is popular for data science and machine learning. Junior software developer roles often seem to ask for C languages. People who know Javascript talk about it as if it’s magic and everything will eventually be a web app anyway. Bring popcorn for the Stack Overflow / reddit / Quora debates on which languages beginners should be learning.      
        </p>
        <p>
            It seems like particular languages and ways of working go in and out of fashion, become favoured by different industries for different applications, and can gradually become obsolete (or at least, less supported, and less widely used). To PHP or not to PHP? That is, if perhaps not the question, then one of many important questions.[6] Maybe what all of this illustrates is that it is a good idea as a developer to prepare for a lifetime of learning, in order to stay on top of the skills, knowledge, and conventions conducive to current and future industry-specific ways of working.      
        </p>
        <p>
            Soft skills are important too. When I decided to pivot from academia onto this path, I thought pretty much exclusively about whether or not I’d be able to get to grips with the technical aspects of coding. On this point, I found one particular <a href="https://medium.com/@zacernst/leaving-academia-for-the-private-sector-seven-years-later-fbb7849182f6" target="_blank">article</a> rather enlightening. It’s written by Zachary Ernst, currently a machine learning technical lead, having worked in tech for the last seven years, but who is, like me, ex-philosophy faculty. Zachary points out that there’s a tendency for academics (and perhaps other career changers) to dedicate themselves to technical upskilling, but not necessarily apply themselves to thinking about the soft skills necessary for successful teamwork in software development.    
        </p>
        <p>
            Many of these skills are transferable from an academic background, such as the ability to explain and justify why you chose to use this method or technique over another, or the ability to pass onto others skills you’ve only recently learned yourself. But according to Zachary, other soft skills relevant for successful software development are actually traits that are frowned upon in academia – for instance, admitting when you don’t understand something, and need someone else in the team to help you out. As Zachary acknowledges, holding back that you’re stuck on something from your team in software development is a real nail in the coffin for successful collaborative working, particularly under the agile model of development. As a result, I’m making a commitment to make sure I speak up when I don’t understand, since it’s ultimately going to backfire for the whole team and the whole project if I don’t.

        <h2>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board. </h2>
        <p>
            As with many creative processes in IT and beyond, making this website has been about breaking down the process into a series of achievable tasks, and implementing project management techniques to complete them on time. I’ve used Trello keep track of the necessary tasks, organised according to Kanban principles, with ‘To Do’, ‘In Progress’, and ‘Done’ lists.[7] I personally find splitting ‘To Do’ into ‘now’ and ‘next’ lists to get a better sense of priorities, and the academic in me cannot resist a ‘Review’ list for the final once-over before cards hit the ‘Done’ pile. See my Trello Board <a href="https://trello.com/b/pgw3YRWl/front-end-assignment" target="_blank">here</a>. Oh, and yes, it’s the <em>front end</em> of a goat, get it? I’ll leave it up to you to wonder whether my team’s Trello board for our back end project employed the same joke…

        <h2>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h2>
        <p>
            From the lightning talks we’ve attended during this course (including from Gemma Hackney, Senior Software Developer at Royal London; Philip Mundy, CEO of Pando Health; David Igoe, Dead of Development at AO.com; Jack Needham, Co-founder of Livitay; and Colin Maclachlan, motion capture artist) there seems to be a common theme: Tech is an industry where innovation is fast moving, competitors emerge quickly, and market shares move rapidly. Whilst this seems to have impacted start-ups who’ve had to abandon projects in the face of competition, it also works both ways: if innovation is fast moving, further opportunities will come around quickly to which you can apply yourself and your ideas.         
        </p>
        <p>
            Following on from what was discussed in 1.2, being a developer with an attitude of inflexibility regarding languages, skills, and conventions, might impact on the success of your project. But furthermore, one might think there could be a lot of opportunities to get lost in the technical aspects coding, and neglect all of the soft skills conducive to effective team working –  such as listening to each other, being prepared to work with constructive criticism, asking for help when you’re stuck, good time management, conflict resolution, and staying in touch with your team regarding what you’re working on. Finding good routines for communicating (such as regular team stand ups), developing an attitude of humility about your work, and preparing for that life time of learning, all seem like good ways to guard against these potential issues.

        <h2>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h2>
        <p>
            Developers will want to choose a good IDE (Integrated Development Environment), with features that support efficient working – I don’t have time to close my own brackets and tags! Seriously, though, I’m early on in my journey, but I’ve used VS Code, Sublime Text, and IDLE thus far, and I like them each for different reasons. Sublime feels light and stable, and some of my favourite features have easy shortcuts (e.g. using multiple cursors for editing multiple blocks). VS Code seems to have more features, but also more bugs, which is challenging when you’re still learning to tell these apart from genuinely broken code. But I’ve also learned a few better habits as a result (e.g. clearing the formatting on instructional text I copy into the editor, and making sure there aren’t multiple terminals running on top of each other). For Python, I quite like having a visually different IDE open to the one I’m coding in (such as the IDLE shell) which I use for referring to the libraries and calling help on different methods therein, whilst I’m coding elsewhere. I suppose everyone develops their own favourite ways of working, and I’m still learning what works best for me.         
        </p>
        <p>
            For web development, there’s the matter of choosing a good browser with good support for your projects. Personally, I like Chrome, particularly the layout and appearance of the “Inspect” feature, so I use that.     
        </p>
        <p>
            One resource that’s proving invaluable on this journey is Google, and coding forums like Stack Overflow. At this stage of my journey, every single problem I’ve had has been carefully explained and answered by at least five people somewhere on Stack Overflow. I’ve heard many people say that being an efficient Googler is a vital skill for developers.     
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond actually writing code, there’s the tech that supports project management and geographically distributed teams (as many software teams are, and will continue to be in the present climate). I’ve previously worked in a distributed team that uses Slack for communications. I like it, and it certainly saves everyone’s inboxes! For WFH meetings, I like Zoom, it seems to have the best algorithms for noise cancellation when there are multiple participants compared with competitors.

        <h2>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control</h2>
        <p>
            I prepared the substantive content of this site outside the IDE, in Word. Obviously it’s much easier to see what’s going on when you’re writing in a word processor, and no one needs to be a hero and write content without a spell checker these days!         
        </p>
        <p>
            As above, using a Kanban approach on Trello has worked well for me. This course is the first time I’ve used Trello. I say a bit more about how it differs to project management styles I’ve employed previously in Unit 1, Outcome 2.     
        </p>
        <p>
            Responding to the above question, Git is a distributed version control system which basically allows multiple people working on the same code to build and test new features in parallel before adding them into the master copy of the code.[8] Github is a repository hosting service for Git, with a number of original features, including “forking” (giving a user who doesn’t have write access to a project their own copy of the code to make modifications), “pull requests” (giving the user who’s made changes the ability to share their repository of modifications with the owner) and “merging” (giving the owner the ability to accept the latter into their project repository).[9, 10, 11] On a very basic level, I think the idea is that if you’re working on some code with, say, 3 functions, and I create a fork in order to add a fourth function, you can continue to update your 3 functions and when my fourth one is ready, you can merge it into your repository whilst preserving your recent updates. So, Git looks super useful for both giving individuals control over different versions of their own code, as well as allowing multiple developers to improve the same program at the same time.

        <h2>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects? </h2>
        <p>
            Tech folks need to be well versed in the demands of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) legislation. GDPR basically sets out a range of conditions which need to be met in order that data is used in lawful, fair, accurate, and protected ways. Since the Data Protection Act of 2018, there are new accountability and transparency requirements.[12] For instance, organisations holding personal data must inform individuals that they are doing so, individuals must be able to exercise their informed consent as part of this process, and data must be deleted once the purpose for which it was collected has been fulfilled.
