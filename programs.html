            I thought I'd add a few trinkets of my favourite bits of Python code written during the course, to illustrate that point about enjoying writing little programs that do fun things.

        <h2>Prime generator: loops</h2>
        <p>
            We were set the task of writing a program to print prime numbers between 1 - 20 using for loops. The way I did this was to nest a loop for the factors inside another for the range of 20. It took me a while to work this out - interestingly enough, it wasn't the maths, but the <em>scope</em> of the if/else logic (particularly of the Prime variable). As a philosopher, I thought logic was my thing? So I'll admit I took it quite personally whilst I was stuck on this for a while. All the sweeter when I finally got it. Assign to "number" whatever value you want it to test up to (inclusive!), then click the play button.

        <h2>Prime generator: function</h2>
        <p>
            Whilst I was stuck on the program above, I decided to also have a go at writing a function to do the same job. Here's the result. At this point I'd also found out how to break loops in Python, so that's incorporated here. Doing this helped me to think through the scope for the nested for loops, go back, and fix it. Assign the desired values in "range" at the bottom of the code.

        <h2>Teleport "animation"</h2>
        <p>
            Here's a fun thing with for loops that I wrote for the "teleport" option in our RPG earlier in the course. I thought this was cool because it achieved printing something to the screen that looks like multiple lines of characters that have been copied and pasted over and over, but actually it's just two for loops manipulating a single string to increase or decrease its indent.

        <h2>adj+expl+obj insult generator (NSFW!)</h2>
        <p>
            I'll say right now that this is absolutely <em>NOT safe for work</em>. The code is hidden and it's very much up to you if you want to run it... I wrote this after my friend posted to Facebook that the perfect formula for an insult is the following: a negative adjective + an expletive / naughty word + a mundane object. The post exploded, with plenty of our friends adding fantastic examples of the formula in action. This happened the day after we learned about the random module in Python. What an excellent way to test my knowledge of random methods, thought I...
