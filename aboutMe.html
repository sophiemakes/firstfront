        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm Sophie! I have experience in event management, journalism, tech PR, and for the bulk of my career to date, <a href="https://research.birmingham.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/sophie-stammers(852a61ff-0213-47dc-83bf-e59574681015)/publications.html" target="_blank">academic research</a>. My academic background is philosophy, but my research has been within interdisciplinary research <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/generic/perfect/index.aspx" target="_blank">teams</a>, focusing on cognitive biases, mental health stigma, the impact of social media on political views, and the implications of these things for policy. What I’ve really enjoyed about this work is the dissemination of ideas – making research findings accessible and actionable for the people they most impact. However, the majority of your time as an academic is targeted at publishing research in peer review journals that are both stylistically and financially inaccessible to people outside academia.

        <h2>Sharing ideas…</h2>
        <p>
            Tech is changing the way that the world consumes and uses information, and increasingly, I find myself thinking about how an idea that I once might have squirrelled away in some pay-walled journal might be better communicated through more interactive and accessible means. This led to an interest in software and web development. From the explosion of health tech apps, to fact checker websites, and even to how software developers can confront stereotypes and biases in the very way they organise their code and processes, I’ve found a world where ideas can be tried, tested, built, scaled up, and could ultimately reach many more people in a more exciting and accessible way. I’ve discovered that I find writing (simple – so far!) <a href="programs.html" target="_blank">programs</a> that get little jobs done intensely absorbing and satisfying, and I’m delighted to have found this new opportunity for almost endless learning and creativity.

        <h2>Common ancestors</h2>
        <p>
            You might not think there’s much crossover between philosophy and coding. But actually, today’s software developers and theoretical philosophers share many common ancestors (for instance, George Boole, of type <code>bool</code> fame, was a philosopher and logician), as well as common habits (e.g. thinking about distant possibilities, and building them into our thought-systems / code tests). A good subset of each of us also both prefer to start counting from 0, but that’s another story…

        <h2>Other stuff I like doing</h2>
        <p>
            I have a bunch of hobbies. I play guitar in Bristol based folk trio <a href="https://www.facebook.com/othertongues/" target="_blank">Other Tongues</a>, and since Lockdown and not being able to play together, I've been making <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgYChLpw1mY=" target="_blank">silly songs</a> about how much I miss my friends. I've also recently go into gardening and growing my own veg (hence the green theme on this site). It reminds me a bit of learning to code in that there always feels like a lot of fiddly work upfront, and then all of a sudden the project takes off and things start to fill out and look cool rather quickly! I love the outdoors in general, particularly walking in the Welsh mountains, and along the South West Coastal Path, and rock climbing.
