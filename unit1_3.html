        <h2>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams? </h2>
        
        <p>    
            In terms of the IT tools: following on from what was discussed in both 1.2.1 and 1.2.2: VS Code has nice features like highlighting syntax errors which clearly make you more efficient – it’s much easier if that missing ‘>’ turns things red, than trying to find errors like that yourself. I didn’t turn on the browser sync function for live updates, it didn’t seem necessary for a simple static website, but perhaps features like that will be useful for more complex websites with animated graphics, etc. I’m quite new to Trello, and I don’t find it super obvious, things like having to look up how to delete a card, which as I mention in 1.2.2 works via the archive, felt like they took unnecessary time. Where’s the right-click instant delete feature?? Oh well, I suppose I know how to use it now, so next time let’s hope I’ll be more efficient. 
        </p>
        <p>     
            There are so many ways building this could have happened more efficiently! Partly this a facet of me building the site as I learn, and so there was no grand overview of how the project was going to end up at the start. Working in teams would certainly have helped. There are a range of distinct jobs which could have been allocated: researcher, content writer, designer, front end development, UX tester. I’ll talk about all of this in more depth in 3.3 below.

            I’d ideally have taken more time to understand flexbox a bit better - my use of it was very trial and error driven! I set myself the task of playing some <a href="https://flexboxfroggy.com/" target="_blank">Flexbox Froggy </a>on my Trello page, realised that I wouldn’t have time to do this before I needed to build the nav bar and index. Rest assured I shall be sending that frog all around the screen as soon as I get a spare moment.

        <h2>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h2>
        
        <p>    
            I’ve talked a lot about what happens at the computer. But there are range of ways to improve productivity and efficiency, via looking after health and wellbeing. Time away from the screen is extremely important. I can find it hard to pull myself away from things I’m really into, but there are a range of break-time apps that will fade or even freeze your screen to help remind you to rest (I’ve used Time Out).  
        </p>
        <p>     
            I like to do a few stretches and simple exercises that help diffuse tension built up at the desk, as well as having a cup of tea, and whilst we’re working from home, catch up on house gossip with my co-workers (one man, two cats). I might even pop out to the garden and see how the plants are doing, give them a water, or five minutes of weeding here and there. 
        </p>
        <p>     
            I’ve had that thing where you’re staring at your code (in this case Python) for what seems like hours, trying to find a bug, and it’s something stupid like a missing “:” that you see immediately after you’ve gone away for a quick stretch, coffee, and a chat to a cat. This is a solo project, but for team work, nothing beats chatting to someone else - showing them your work if possible, and asking for help when stuck, knowing you’ll be able to offer it back at some point.

        <h2>• 3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack? </h2>
        
        <p>    
            As suggested above in 3.1, I built this simultaneously with learning how to build it. That meant I was doing things learning what different CSS selectors and property-value pairs look like visually, whilst at the same time coming up with the design. That meant a lot of unnecessary coding prior to settling on a design I liked. A much better way to do this would have been to fix the design in programme dedicated to that (e.g. InDesign) first off, and then replicate it in code later. 
        </p>
        <p>     
            In some teams, this sort of job might well be distributed across members anyway, with e.g. a designer making a pdf or image file of the design, and a developer translating all of that into code. You might have separate people researching relevant material and developing the written content. Then there might be someone who hasn’t been working on any aspect of the development doing the testing, both in terms of whether the code works as a should, as well testing the user experience from the perspective of fresh eyes. For instance, I think I’ve been looking at my site for too long to be able to tell if there are too many plants on it – I mean, I really like plants, so perhaps that skews my perspective of how nice this whole thing really looks…?

        <h2>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions  </h2>
        
        <p>    
            As I’m new to this, I’ve tested pretty much every change I made to the code as I went along, just to ensure it was making the visual differences that I was expecting. I expect that as you get better at this, you’ll do less of that.  I’m aware that there is still as LOT of CSS I haven’t used and there’s also no Javascript here, so I expect this will be my method (at least in the building stages) for the foreseeable future! 
        </p>
        <p>     
            I expect that in professional situations there will be a lot more emphasis on UX in the testing phase – how things look and feel. And of course once there’s Javascript and a backend, things get a lot more complex. In these cases you might also have some team members writing automated tests which check how the code deals with all possible combinations of user behaviours, which can be adapted for each update.
