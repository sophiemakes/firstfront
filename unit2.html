        <h2>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page  </h2>
        
        <p>    
            Structurally, the home page is quite minimal, containing a welcome message, and then six (flexbox!) boxes with links to the other assignment pages. I’ve gone for a plant inspired theme, for the background images, with each box displaying a small version (using the “cover” value in CSS) of the background image of the page it points to. These will obediently lay themselves out according to the way you resize the window. There’s a bit of CSS styling on the images (specifically, a sepia filter) to draw them together colour-wise. The one box which doesn’t link to a page (contact) uses a mailto link with my email address. 
        </p>
        <p>     
            The structure of the assignment pages is the same. At the top, we have what I’ve perhaps generously been calling a “nav bar” (as I mentioned in the review section, I’d have liked the link to attach to the whole box, like a button, and to be pinned to the top of the page). This also uses flexbox syntax, this time, to squish up obediently when you resize. Like the homepage, it is styled with background images from the pages each link points to.  
        </p>
        <p>     
            As for the main content – questions and their answers – we’ve got some heading text, and then the content text inside divs which are transparent green, slightly rounded at the corners, slightly stepped in from the edges due to the margin, and slightly padded from the edge of the div. Thanks CSS! We’ve got a few separate ps inside the divs to space things out a bit. Then, each assignment page has a reference section, with slightly smaller text.   
        </p> 
        <p>
            There’s also an “easter egg” page with similar formatting, but with added Python trinkets – did you find it? Hint: have a closer look at the <a href="aboutMe.html">About Me</a> section...

        <h2>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites  </h2>
        
        <p>    
            Text, media, and code may all be subject to copyright rules on reuse which require the acknowledgement and potentially also the remuneration of the original creators/owners. Developers should therefore be prepared to actively research these when reusing any of the above, and obtain the relevant licenses where necessary. Much material is available under Creative Commons licenses which allow “reasonable” reuse without a fee, with appropriate attributions to the original creators.    
        </p>
        <p>     
            For web developers, mainstream browsers allow us to view the source code of webpages, but that doesn’t mean this code is free to snatch. Developers should tread carefully and be aware that original authors reserve the right to restrict the usage of code that appears to be open source, even that posted on, for instance, Stack Overflow.  This also means that as developers we should be clear about licensing our own code. A useful resource for this is the site <a href="https://choosealicense.com/" target="_blank">Choose A Licence</a>. Curated by GitHub, it gives developers options for how to licence code, depending on what the code is for and how we want it to be shared.    
        </p>
        <p>     
            Some code is expressly designated as open source, and is freely available. But there are still norms surrounding its usage, such as the expectation that if we expand upon such code and/or the applications it sits within, the project remains open source.

        <h2>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them  </h2>
        
        <p>    
            About 1 in 5 people in the UK have a disability . People with disabilities use a range of assistive technologies to facilitate their access to websites and other applications, and developers should be well versed in the relevant policies from the start of any project. For instance, the guidelines linked <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/accessibility-requirements-for-public-sector-websites-and-apps" target="_blank">here</a> cover accessibility for websites associated with public bodies. As an example, they include adding label tags to HTML code so that accessibility readers can make sense of the order in which to read content on a website with a complex layout, as well as adding brief descriptions within image tags.
        </p>

    <div class="content">
        <h2>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h2>
        
        <p>    
            There are a range of factors developers should consider when choosing appropriate filetypes, such as file size, quality after compression, browser support, editability, and accessibility, as touched on in the previous section. For instance, when it comes to images, a filetype that uses lossy compression, thus smaller filesizes, such as JPEG, might be preferable for faster loading speeds (e.g. for multiple images on a constantly updating, content-heavy news website), but one that uses lossless compression, such as PNG, preferable for high image quality (e.g. for a photography blog)   . PDFs might be preferable over word processor filetypes (e.g. Word), for preserving document formatting and preventing editability – unless of course the latter is a desired feature.
